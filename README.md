Deep Learning model trained to classify images of Atronachs in the video game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.
The dataset consisted of 1,600 images: 800 training, 400 validation, and 400 testing.                                                                                     
*One storm atronach image was included in both the training(153) and test(77) set.  This adds 1/400 or 0.25% error to the listed results.                                 
*One frost atronach image was included in both the validation(78) and test(77) set.
